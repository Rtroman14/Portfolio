                I am Ryan Roman, 26 years old seeking a career in front-end development. I have over
                three years’ experience in facility engineering with CR-Building Performance
                Specialists and have dedicated the last year of my life to the study of computer
                language. The combination of my creativity, passion and attention to detail has
                proven to be an asset to all my employers.
            </p>
            <p class="me__text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                My interest in coding was sparked when I began creating macros in Excel to automate
                reports for my current employer. The creative and analytical parts of my mind
                relished the challenge of problem solving, and it was then I decided to learn all I
                could about computer programming. Since then I have dedicated the beginning of
                roughly every day to educating myself in computer language. Genuine interest and
                excitement have driven my relentless dedication to learning.
            </p>
            <p class="me__text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="450">
                I studied Python to establish strong fundamentals in computer language. Due to my
                understanding of fundamentals, I was able to transfer this knowledge to Excel VBA
                and wrote a script to enhance workflow efficiency within my company. The process
                entailed updating a database which included many inputs for conditional datasets.
                With a few hundred lines of code, I was able to automate the entire process.
            </p>
            <p class="me__text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
                This first success has only propelled my interest and added momentum to my coding
                journey. Since then I have used Python to create a web scraper that extracts data
                from LinkedIn to Excel for a company called Summa Media, based out of Denver,
                Colorado. Beyond Python I have completed a Web Developer Bootcamp, advanced course
                in CSS, Sass, Flexbox, and Grid, and am currently working on a React course which
                includes Hooks, React Router, and Redux.

                Who I Am
            </h2>
            <p class="me__text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">
                While my professional experience in this field may not exceed other applicants, it
                is who I am that sets me apart. I come from a background that has demanded success
                from an early age. While my genetic intelligence has brought me this far, it will be
                passion that maximizes my potential. I am a perfectionist whose entire life has be
                driven by two forces, curiosity and achievement.
            </p>
            <p class="me__text" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">
                The obsessive perfectionist in me has made coding an exciting challenge. My goal is
                to eventually master JavaScript and become a full stack developer. I pursue my
                interests to their greatest end, and my journey in computer language has only begun.
                It is easier to give 100 percent rather then 99, and I am all in on the “One” and
                “Zeros.”
